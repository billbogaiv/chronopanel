## What is Chronopanel?

Chronopanel is a highly-accessible and customizable time-display application. Leveraging basic HTML elements and CSS allows it to function with no [client-side scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting). Additionally, the application is designed to have a small network footprint. This translates into quick load-times! Its origin coincides with the re-introduction of the [10k Apart challenge](https://a-k-apart.com/) in 2016.

## Will the app. always be under 10k (related to [10k challenge](https://a-k-apart.com/faq#size))?

At the moment, yes. However, since the main page-size is already close to the limit, any new features will cause the existing flow to be questioned. Even adding minute client scripting is difficult with the current setup.

## Will there be additional styles of panels?

Yes. At the moment, just the [BCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal).
